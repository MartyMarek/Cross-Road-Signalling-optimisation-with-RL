# COSC2673 - Computational Machine Learning
# Assignment 2 Repository

This repository contains the simulation setup and reinforcement learning code for the traffic simulation (Q3). 

For setup to work, the following steps are required:

# 1. Installation of the Sumo environment 
The installation can be found at: https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/

# 2. Required libraries to work with python

We used OpenAI gym framework to to manage and interact with our sumo simulation environment. 

We used stable baselines3 which is a set of libraries of various reinforcement learning algorithms using PyTorch.
Stable-Baselines3 requires python 3.7+ and PyTorch >= 1.11

To install these libraries, the following commands can be used from the python terminal:

pip install torch

pip install gym 

followed by 

pip install stable-baselines3
